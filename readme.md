# Bamboo and wood
This is a repository for creating a rhyme annotated corpus of excavated Han dynasty texts on bamboo or wood. 

## Workplan
FOSTER: Excavated texts:

- [ ] Conduct analyses and input data for the Peking University 蒼頡篇 and 妄稽. Then add 神烏 (from 尹灣), and 孔子衣鏡 (from 海昏侯), both are short. Next look at the 反淫 from the Peking University (which has a parallel in the received corpus called 七發). This is based on my limited knowledge of what is rhyming in the 出土文獻, and probably only the most obvious examples of poems. The work for the 蒼頡篇 is largely done: https://calc.hypotheses.org/2525
- [ ] Contact young Chinese scholars working on linguistics/paleography who may have a better idea of what Han excavated manuscript have rhyming. 
- [ ] If you need more data, then start going through the major Han caches which have literary works (not administrative documents). You will need to see what texts were found, then read them to see their content. [https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中國出土簡帛列表](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%87%BA%E5%9C%9F%E7%B0%A1%E5%B8%9B%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8) offers a relatively up to date list of these caches. I would focus on 馬王堆, 定縣, 銀雀山, and 北大漢簡 at first, then look at 阜陽雙古堆 (the materials are very damaged) and 張家山 (the materials are mostly legal manuscripts, see the 奏讞書 though for potential rhymes). Eventually more of the 海昏侯 cache will be published, and could have more rhyming texts. This is basically a fishing mission however.  陰陽家言 (volume three) in particular, also good to look at.
