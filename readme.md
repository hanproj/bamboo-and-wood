# Bamboo and wood
This is a repository for creating a rhyme annotated corpus of excavated Han dynasty texts on bamboo or wood. 

## Workplan
FOSTER: Excavated texts:

1. Conduct analyses and input data for the Peking University 蒼頡篇 and 妄稽. Then add 神烏 (from 尹灣), and 孔子衣鏡 (from 海昏侯), both are short. Next look at the 反淫 from the Peking University (which has a parallel in the received corpus called 七發). This is based on my limited knowledge of what is rhyming in the 出土文獻, and probably only the most obvious examples of poems. The work for the 蒼頡篇 is largely done: https://calc.hypotheses.org/2525
2. Contact young Chinese scholars working on linguistics/paleography who may have a better idea of what Han excavated manuscript have rhyming. 
3. If you need more data, then start going through the major Han caches which have literary works (not administrative documents). You will need to see what texts were found, then read them to see their content. [https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中國出土簡帛列表](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%87%BA%E5%9C%9F%E7%B0%A1%E5%B8%9B%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8) offers a relatively up to date list of these caches. I would focus on 馬王堆, 定縣, 銀雀山, and 北大漢簡 at first, then look at 阜陽雙古堆 (the materials are very damaged) and 張家山 (the materials are mostly legal manuscripts, see the 奏讞書 though for potential rhymes). Eventually more of the 海昏侯 cache will be published, and could have more rhyming texts. This is basically a fishing mission however.

If you need any help with accessing the primary sources, let me know. Attaching two articles here on the 神烏 (from 尹灣) and 孔子衣鏡 (from 海昏侯) respectively.

There was a very rough list put together at the beginning of the application process, which includes received and excavated texts, you can find it here:

## 妄稽

The poem you are remembering is the 妄稽 from the 北大漢簡 (volume four). A random search led me to this site with a transcription: <https://itw01.com/YMRUME2.html>, though obviously do not use this for your work, just as a quick reference here. The rhyming is really regular and easy to identify. E.g.:

䁝陽幼進，名族周春(*tʰun)。
孝悌慈誨，恭敬仁遜(*[s]ˤu[n])?。
鄉黨莫及，於國無倫(*[r]u[n])。
辭讓送揖，俗節理義(*ŋ(r)aj-s)。
行步周還，進退矜倚(*Cə.q(r)ajʔ)。
顏色容貌，美好姱麗(*[r]ˤe-s)。
精潔貞廉，不肯淫議(*ŋ(r)aj-s)。
血氣齊疾，心不怒㬥(*m-pˤawk)?。
力勁決觡，不好手扷(*bˤot-s)。
勇若孟賁，未嘗色撓(*m-[q]ʰˤrewʔ)。
見鄉長者，先言後笑(*[s-l]aw-s)。
其父母愛之，眾人願以為子(*tsəʔ)。
邑國闔鄉，撫於鄉里(*(mə.)rəʔ)。
周春之賢，鄉黨無有(*[ɢ]ʷəʔ)。
敦次忠篤，善養父母(*məʔ)。
親戚皆悅，語及子私(*[s]əj)。
謀鄉長者，欲為娶妻(*[tsʰ]ˤəj)。
... and so forth...

There are other texts from the 北大 collection that are rhymed or have rhymes, with the 蒼頡篇 the most obvious. Others to look into include the 反淫 (also volume four, mirrors 七發 with new content and wording), and the 陰陽家言 (volume three) in particular, though you might find occasional rhyming in others too.

The others mentioned on that list are the 神烏賦 (attaching an article for reference) from Yinwan, and at some point I added in a poem written on a dressing mirror from the 海昏侯 find (attached an article for that too). Not mentioned is a short poem from the 敦煌漢簡 ([https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/敦煌漢簡風雨詩](https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/%E6%95%A6%E7%85%8C%E6%BC%A2%E7%B0%A1%E9%A2%A8%E9%9B%A8%E8%A9%A9)).

I have PDFs of most of the manuscript publications, if needed. For a convenient quick check of what's out there in terms of unearthed wood and bamboo manuscripts, this wiki has a relatively up-to-date list: 
[https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中國出土簡帛列表](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%87%BA%E5%9C%9F%E7%B0%A1%E5%B8%9B%E5%88%97%E8%A1%A8)

## one poem from Dunhuang

Hey there, yes! The 敦煌漢簡 poem will be a quick entry. It can be found as strip #2253 in the volume 敦煌漢簡 (and as Nathan linked, the text is also here for quick reference: https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/敦煌漢簡風雨詩). The main rhymes are 多, 沙, 河, 波, 加, 池, 何 and 過 (all Baxter & Sagart's *-aj). 
N.b. that another version of the same poem is included in a recently published collection, 新見漢牘蒼頡篇史篇校釋, where the only change in rhyme words is 池:他. This is a looted manuscript, not authenticated, and should be used with caution, if included at all at this point.
As for the 陰陽家言  (in volume three of the Peking University collection), I admit this is only really a guess on my part after a quick skim. There may be rhyming, may not be rhyming, so save this to the very end of your priorities, perhaps a first step in the "fishing" part of your workflow.
Best,
Chris
