Hey there, yes! The 敦煌漢簡 poem will be a quick entry. It can be found as strip #2253 in the volume 敦煌漢簡 (and as Nathan linked, the text is also here for quick reference: https://zh.wikisource.org/zh-hans/敦煌漢簡風雨詩). The main rhymes are 多, 沙, 河, 波, 加, 池, 何 and 過 (all Baxter & Sagart's *-aj). N.b. that another version of the same poem is included in a recently published collection, 新見漢牘蒼頡篇史篇校釋, where the only change in rhyme words is 池:他. This is a looted manuscript, not authenticated, and should be used with caution, if included at all at this point. As for the 陰陽家言 (in volume three of the Peking University collection), I admit this is only really a guess on my part after a quick skim. There may be rhyming, may not be rhyming, so save this to the very end of your priorities, perhaps a first step in the "fishing" part of your workflow. Best, Chris
