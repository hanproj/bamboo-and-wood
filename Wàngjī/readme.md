# Wàngjī 妄 稽

The poem you are remembering is the 妄稽 from the 北大漢簡 (volume four). A random search led me to this site with a transcription: https://itw01.com/YMRUME2.html, though obviously do not use this for your work, just as a quick reference here. The rhyming is really regular and easy to identify.
